# Smart-Library-Management-System-SLMS-

# Project Description
Smart Library Management System (SLMS) is a Java-based console application designed to help students understand core Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming concepts in a practical way.
The system uses LinkedList, Stack, Searching, and modular object-oriented classes to manage library operations smoothly.
It simulates the everyday functions of a real library, allowing users to manage books efficiently.

# Key Features
Add New Books – Store Book ID, Title, and Author
View All Books – Displays all books with Issued/Available status
Search Book – Find a book by its unique ID
Issue Book – Mark a book as issued
Return Book – Mark an issued book as returned
Undo Operation – Reverse the last action using a Stack
Clean OOP Structure – Well-organized classes (Book, Library, Main)
